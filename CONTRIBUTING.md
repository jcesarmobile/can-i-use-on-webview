# Contributing to CanIUseOnWebView

If you want to know if an API is supported, you can create an issue. But please, link the API docs on MDN or a similar site.

If you want to add a new example, I recommend copying the template folder and rename to the name of the API.
Then you can put your web code in the www folder and read the README.md instructions to know how to copy it to the native projects.
The native projects are ready to run the app inside a WebView.
